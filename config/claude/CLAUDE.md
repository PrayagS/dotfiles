## Core Principles

- **Investigate patterns** - Look for existing examples, understand established conventions, don't reinvent what already exists
- **Confirm approach** - Explain your reasoning, show what you found in the codebase, list potential challenges and edge cases, get consensus before proceeding
- **State your case if you disagree** - Present multiple viewpoints when architectural decisions have trade-offs

## Tool Usage

- When performing multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously
- After receiving tool results, carefully reflect on their quality before proceeding
- Plan and iterate based on new information, then take the best next action
- **Web search**: Use the `gemini-cli` skill instead of the `WebSearch` tool
- **YAML files**: Use the `yaml-reader` skill instead of the Read tool for `.yaml`/`.yml` files
