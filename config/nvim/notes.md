- `e` is sometimes better than `w` when trying to select words.
- `<C-o>` in insert mode takes you to normal mode for just one movement and then
  puts you back in insert mode.
- Some useful insert mode motions,
  ```
  CTRL-W    delete word to the left of cursor
  CTRL-O D  delete everything to the right of cursor
  CTRL-U    delete everything to the left of cursor
  CTRL-H    backspace/delete
  CTRL-J    insert newline (easier than reaching for the return key)
  CTRL-T    indent current line
  CTRL-D    un-indent current line
  ```
- Ctrl-d in vim,
  ```
  1. search for text
  2. `cgn` to change the highlighted text
  3. dot repeat
  ```
