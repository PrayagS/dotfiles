# WIP

# Let the ricing begin!

Welcome to my dotfiles! Huge credits to folks over at [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/). Not quite an original rice but bits and pieces joined together from different places.

## Overview

- Terminal - [st](https://github.com/PrayagS/st) (my build) and colors can be found in .Xresources
- Shell - [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/). Along with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) as the plugin manager
- Shell prompt - [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k). A faster drop-in replacement of powerlevel9k. Its config can be found in .p10k.zsh
- WM - [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3). Fork of i3 (a tiling window manager) enabling gaps between windows
- Status Bar - [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar). Easily configurable status bar
- Launcher - [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi). For those who find dmenu ancient
- Others - [dunst](https://dunst-project.org/) for notifications, [sxhkd](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd) for keyboard hotkeys and [compton](https://github.com/tryone144/compton) (tryone's fork) for transparency effects.
